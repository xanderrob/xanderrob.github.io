# Equilibrium Diagrams

Lead-tin Phase Diagram 
![[Pasted image 20250820091526.png]]
The areas represent different phases, such as liquid, solid, or a mixture such as solid + liquid.

Percentage that is solid:
$$f_{S} = \frac{C_L - C_0}{C_L - C_{S}}$$
Percentage that is liquid:
$$f_{L} = \frac{C_0 - C_S}{C_L - C_S}$$

## What is Eutectic?

Eutectic means a mixture of two or more substances that has the lowest possible melting point for that combination which is lower than the melting point of any of the individual components. It will be the lowest point that is a liquid on the phase diagram. 

This is different to a eutectoid, which is similar, except it involves a solid phase transforming into two other solid phases. An example is a iron-carbon phase diagram.

![[Pasted image 20251026134714.png]]

Hypoeutectic and hypereutectic describe alloys that are not at the eutectic composition, meaning they are either to the left (hypoeutectic) or right (hypereutectic) of the eutectic point on a phase diagram. The same goes for eutectoids.

## Ferrite and Cementite

**Ferrite**

- **Description**:
    Also known as alpha iron, it is a phase of iron with a body-centred cubic (BCC) crystal structure. 
- **Carbon Solubility**:
    It can hold only a very small amount of carbon in solution, at most about 0.02 wt%. 
- **Properties**:
    It is soft, ductile, and a ferromagnetic material below its Curie temperature. 
- **Role**:
    It is a common constituent in steels, providing toughness and ductility. 

**Cementite**

- **Description**: A hard and brittle intermetallic compound of iron and carbon with the chemical formula
- **Carbon Content**: It has a fixed composition of 6.67% carbon by weight. 
- **Properties**: It is very hard and resistant to wear. 
- **Role**: Its presence significantly increases the hardness and strength of steel.

## Pearlite

Pearlite is a two-phase structure of alternating layers of ferrite (iron) and cementite (iron carbide) found in steels and cast irons. It forms during the slow cooling of an iron-carbon alloy below a specific temperature, creating a mixture that provides a combination of strength and ductility. Under a microscope, this layered structure can look similar to mother-of-pearl, which is how it got its name. 

How it forms
- **Starting material:** 
    Pearlite begins as [austenite](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sca_esv=c93c0cfcce8e189b&cs=1&q=austenite&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjO592ajsGQAxW0UGcHHYO6MKMQxccNegQIHxAB&mstk=AUtExfAsre9vC36oVfquDLlC3dxOyu11jL5hzt_aoTRji1gT1HcX2_f2dhSIUUtu80NX3aOkHlUoHMvFSkAmdVhmMqfKdHdXx6gB0y67IHKK_NjH4apwhoAdmkooPoQn7Ay0cTpvsva3Q1A4Uu3ym4SMm90-hlzKzz8Bpc1NAUnUgzyAA4w&csui=3), a high-temperature phase of iron that can hold a lot of carbon. 
- **Slow cooling:** 
    As the austenite cools slowly, the iron atoms arrange themselves into layers of ferrite, which pushes carbon atoms ahead of it. 
- **Cementite formation:** 
    Eventually, there are not enough carbon atoms left to form more ferrite, so they combine to create iron carbide (cementite). 
- **Layered structure:** 
    This process continues, creating the characteristic layered or [lamellar structure](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sca_esv=c93c0cfcce8e189b&cs=1&q=lamellar+structure&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjO592ajsGQAxW0UGcHHYO6MKMQxccNegQIIBAB&mstk=AUtExfAsre9vC36oVfquDLlC3dxOyu11jL5hzt_aoTRji1gT1HcX2_f2dhSIUUtu80NX3aOkHlUoHMvFSkAmdVhmMqfKdHdXx6gB0y67IHKK_NjH4apwhoAdmkooPoQn7Ay0cTpvsva3Q1A4Uu3ym4SMm90-hlzKzz8Bpc1NAUnUgzyAA4w&csui=3) of pearlite, with alternating layers of ferrite and cementite.

## Austenite
Austenite is a solid solution of iron and carbon, also known as gamma (𝛾) iron, that forms in steel alloys when heated to high temperatures. It has a face-centred cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which allows it to hold more carbon than other iron phases like ferrite. This high-temperature phase is stable in certain stainless steels even at room temperature, thanks to the addition of elements like nickel.
# Stress/Strain Diagrams

# Types of Steels
## Low carbon/Mild Steel
Mild steel/low carbon is the most widely used form of carbon steel. This steel usually has a carbon content of less than 0.30 wt. %. Low carbon steels have 0.07-0.15% carbon content and is the most common grade of carbon steel. Some of the most common applications for low carbon steels are: automobile/car components, including bodies, fenders, pans, and transmission covers. Also, structures shapes, carburised parts, washers, nails, rivets, bushings. Mild carbon steel is used for structural plates and sections, stampings, forgings, seamless tubes and boilerplate.

Mild carbon steels contain 0.15-0.3% carbon. Mild carbon steel contains ferrite, which is a soft and ductile form of iron. It also contains pearlite, with a small amount of cementite, which is hard and brittle. The small amount of cementite provides the steel with toughness, allowing the material to be shaped without fracture.

## Medium Carbon Steels
Medium carbon steels contain 0.30-0.60 wt. % and a manganese content of 0.60 - 1.65 wt. %. Hardened medium carbon steels have greater strength than low-carbon steels, however this is at the expense of ductility and toughness. Popular applications of medium carbon steel include shafts, axles, gears, crankshafts, rails, and railway wheels. 

## High Carbon Steels
High carbon steels contain 0.60-1.25% carbon. An application of a high carbon steel is in springs, as they need to be able to resist deformation under pressure, it also needs to be fatigue resistant for their springiness, so they can withstand repeated flexing and bending without breakage.

A second application of high carbon steel is cutting tools, such as dies industrial knives, or punches, as they need to be very hard and very strong to cut or punch out shapes.

## Ultra-high carbon steels
Ultra-high carbon steels contain 1.25-2% carbon, and are known as an experimental alloy. 

## Microstructures of Plain Carbon Steels
0% carbon: All white ferrite grains (no pearlite)
0.2% carbon: 75% ferrite grains and 25% pearlite grains
0.4% carbon: half ferrite grains and half pearlite grains
0.6% carbon: 25% ferrite grains and 75% pearlite grains
0.8% carbon: All striped pearlite grains (no ferrite grains)
# Plastics
## Polylactic Acid
Polylactic acid is used for biodegradable medical devices such as screws, pins, rods, and plates that are expected to biodegrade within 6-12 months.

## Polyethylene
Polyethylene is a thermoplastic polymer with a variable crystalline structure and a vast range of applications depending on the particular type. Low density Polyethylene is widely used for plastic packaging, such as for grocery bags or plastic wrap. High density polyethylene, by contrast, has common applications in construction, like in the fabrication of drain pipes. Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene has high-performance applications in things such as medical devices and bullet proof vests. 

LDPE is a very flexible material with unique flow properties that makes it particularly suitable for shopping bags and other plastic film applications. LDPE has high ductility but low tensile strength, which is evident in the real world by its propensity to stretch when strained. 

HDPE is a robust, moderately stiff plastic with a highly crystalline structure. It is frequently used in plastic for milk cartons, laundry detergent, garbage bins, and cutting boards. 

Polyethylene insulation is sold in a wide variety of electrically nonconductive forms. Wires insulated with a polyethylene coating are abrasion-resistant and rigid. That rigity factor can make the sheathing inflexible, which is why its often infused with special fillers and additives.

## Polypropylene
Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic addition polymer made of the combination of propylene monomers. It is used in a variety of applications to include packaging for consumer products, plastic parts for various products including laboratory equipment, electronics and automobile products, special devices like living hinges, and textiles. Today it is one of the most commonly produced plastics in the world. It is good for housewares, utensils, sportswear, toys, and medical and laboratory equipment for industrial applications. Given its durability and outstanding characteristics, PP has spread throughout different industries.

## Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene
ABS is an opaque thermoplastic and amorphous polymer. It has a strong resistance to corrosive chemicals and physics impacts. It is very easy to machine and has a low melting temperature making it particularly simple to use in injection moulding manufacturing processes or 3D printing on an FDM machine. ABS is also relatively inexpensive around $1.50 per 0.5kg. ABS is used for keys on computer keyboards, power tool housing, car dashboards, the plastic face guard on wall sockets, and LEGO toys. ABS is commonly used as a 3D printer filament. ABS is very structurally sturdy which is why it is used in things like camera housings, protective housings, and packaging. 

# Types of Motion 
Linear motion - In a straight line

# Mechanical Advantage and Velocity Ratio
## Velocity Ratio
$$VR=\frac{\text{driven}}{\text{driver}}$$
$$VR=\frac{d_E}{d_L}$$
## Mechanical Advantage
$$MA=\frac{F_L}{F_E}$$
$$MA=\text{E}\times VR$$
